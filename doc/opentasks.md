To ensure further development and to get to the bottom of some open bugs, I need the following data:

# Connection Assist (advanced users)
There is a tool called Connection Assist that can download log files from SHM2.
Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, the tool doesn't work for me.

To help me diagnose the error, it would be extremely helpful if someone could capture the traffic between Connection Assist and SHM2, e.g. using Wireshark. Then I could compare at the network level and perhaps find the cause.

# Sunny Explorer (advanced users with specific inverters)
This only applies to people whose Speedwire inverters do not work at all or only work intermittently with my library.


It would be helpful if I could get a complete copy of the network traffic between Sunny Explorer and the inverter. 
I need a complete interaction from the start of Sunny Explorer, through the discovery and the login, dialogues with various data clicks, 
and until the termination of Sunny Explorer.

You can use Wireshark or a similar tool to capture the network traffic.
